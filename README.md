## Info
Welcome to WipeTool! A simple and convenient way to handle transitions in your Godot projects!
Designed for both mid-scene transitions and between scene transitions, you can streamline the process of going from one thing to the next with very little code, great visuals,
and some additional performance during scene transitions using asynchronous loading and viewport capturing.
